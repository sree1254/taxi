# Technical Workflow.

# FrontEnd
-> Once we start the application Angualr will take control. Angualr 5 will work on component basis (every component will have one typescript .ts file and .html file. .ts file will have the logic and render the data and will pass it to .html file). And Default componenet in this application is App Component (app.component.ts)

# app.component.ts
In this comonent we will check if any admin/support person is logged in or not. if logged in app.component.ts will redirect to dashboard.component.ts. If not logged in it will redirect to login.component.ts

# login.component.ts
In this component it will collect the username, password and pass the details to custom service. All the API calls in this app are been managed by a custom service(api.service.ts). custom service will retun the response. If the response is true then the username and user tocken will be saved in local server and user will be redirected to dashboard page. If response is false the "Invalid credentials message will be displayed"

# api.service.ts (Custom Injectable service)
